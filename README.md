- **As a developer**, you can choose to work on projects that missions that resonate with you. Your volunteer profile will be visible to the public (if you choose), and you will receive credit for projects that both completed and undergoing development.

- **As a nonprofit**, you can find the right developer to fit your software needs. You will have the capability to browse and filter through developer profiles until you have found the person that is right for your mission.

### Back-End
##### Startup The Servers:
`mongo` and `node server.js` from the backend directory.

* Some cURL commands you can use:

**SIGNUP @ /api/signup**  
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"test-username","password":"test-password","email":"test-email"}' http://localhost:3000/signup

It will return a token back that looks like:
`"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjU4ZTZiZmE0YzQzNWRlMTc4ZDNkNDMwOCIsImlhdCI6MTQ5MTUxNzM0OX0.puW8L-9J_3VaAeaxG-RMnbt3ufIe-8kXAMygzXc1xrE"`

**LOGIN @ /api/login**

Setup your token to a local variable with `export TOKEN=<string>` then
```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/login
```
